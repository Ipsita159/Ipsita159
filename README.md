# 💫 About Me:
I approach software engineering as both a science and an art.<br><br>I am building a strong foundation in core computer science principles—algorithms, data structures, and system design—while learning to write clean, well-structured, and maintainable code.<br><br>My focus is on understanding the theory behind software and applying it thoughtfully through experimentation and practice. I value clarity over complexity, depth over shortcuts, and long-term thinking over quick fixes.<br><br>This space represents my learning journey, exploration, and gradual refinement as I grow as an engineer.<br><br>Always learning, always improving—working toward engineering solutions that stand the test of time.
